  "Macro Nutrients":
      "What are macronutriens? Our bodies use them as a source of energy that comes from the food we eat. Proteins, Carbohydrates and Fats make up the three different types of macronutrients. Carbohydrates have 4 calories per gram, Protein has 4 calories per gram, and Fat has 9 calories per gram. The recommended percentages for an average macronutrient consumption at each meal of the day are as follows: 40–55% Carbohydrates, 30–35% Protein, and 15–30% Fats.",
  "Fats":
      "Just as protein comprises important amino acids, so does Fat, which is composed of tiny units called fatty acids. These Fatty acids are crucial since our bodies cannot create them and we must consume them from the foods we eat in order for our bodies to function properly. When establishing what constitutes a healthy Fat, it's important to distinguish between saturated, unsaturated, and trans Fats. There is evidence that saturated and trans Fats raise the risk of heart disease and a host of other issues. On the other hand unsaturated Fat has been shown to decrease the risks. They can be found in things like nuts, seeds and oils.",
  "Proteins":
      "We advise using between 30-35% Protein in each meal for a guildline. We need Protein in our diet since it is primarily used to build new tissues for growth and to repair muscle. When we consume a Low-Carbohydrate diet, our bodies will convert protein into energy instead of using it for its intended purpose. Protein is broken down into building components known as amino acids by the body when its absorbed. Although there are 500 identified amino acids, humans only require 21 of them to thrive. There are nine of these, known as the essential amino acids, that the body cannot make on its own. These can be found in a variety of meats and Protein-rich foods.",
  "Calories":
      "The amount of energy in food and beverages is measured using an energy unit called a calorie. Typically, ladies should consume 2,000 calories per day while men should consume 2,500. We were all born differently, have different cultures, and live in different climates, so it's a little silly to stick with those numbers. The average value should only be used as a general benchmark; it should be adjusted to meet your particular physical make-up, state of health, and objectives. To lose weight, you must consume fewer calories than your body needs, and to gain weight, you must consume more calories than your body needs.",
  "Carbohydrates":
      "Humans genuinely require Carbohydrates to perform at their highest level both physically and psychologically. And Yes, you can absolutely eat Carbohydrates and lose weight; they are not a negative thing to eat. At Body Buddies, we advise having 40–55% Carbohydrates with each meal. Carbohydrates are broken down by your body when you ingest them, making them the body's primary fuel source. The body can use it to grow and repair tissue, as well as to support healthy brain, heart, and kidney function. It also gives the body energy. Unprocessed or minimally processed whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and beans are the healthiest sources of carbs.",
  "Cheat Meal":
      "Give up thinking about food as a good or poor choice or as a way to cheat on your diet. Don't deny yourself the foods you enjoy. Try using the (90% Healthy Food --- 10% Bad Food) strategy rather than treating yourself to a cheat meal cheat day once a week.\nThe 90-10% diet, which was established by precession nutrition, is excellent for helping patients switch from bingeing to healthful eating. The remaining 10% of your daily intake can come from foods that don't typically fit into your daily plan once you've consumed 90% of your daily intake in the form of nutritious Proteins, Carbs, and Fats to fuel your body.\nFor instance, if you eat four meals a day for seven days, that works up to 28 meals every week. You can consume items from the BAD FOOD LIST a maximum of 10% of 28 times per week (3). \n The best approach to living a healthy lifestyle is not to eat as cleanly as possible Monday through Friday, only to wake up on Saturday and consume a high-calorie breakfast and lunch, followed by dinner and a bottle of wine or a few pints of beer. Nonetheless, following a balanced daily diet, your chosen dessert after dinner on Friday, a couple slices of pizza on Saturday night, and a glass of wine during the week are all appropriate."
